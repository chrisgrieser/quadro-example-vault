Example: Show all **extractions** where the dimension "type of compatibility" contains "backward compatibility".

You can also search for this interactively by pressing `cmd+f` (macOS) or `ctrl+f` (Windows) and entering the query `["type of compatibility":backward]` in the search field.


```query
["type of compatibility":backward]
```
