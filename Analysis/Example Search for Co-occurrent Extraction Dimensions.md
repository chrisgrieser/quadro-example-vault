Example: Show all **extractions** where the dimension "cause of the issue" contains "fragmentation", and the dimension "type of compatibility" contains "backward"

You can also search for this interactively by pressing `cmd+shift+f` (macOS) or `ctrl+shift+f` (Windows) and entering the query ``["cause of the issue": fragmentation] ["type of compatibility":backward]`` in the search field.


```query
["cause of the issue": fragmentation] ["type of compatibility":backward]
```
