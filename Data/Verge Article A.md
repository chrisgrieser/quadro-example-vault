Epic is one step closer to opening its iOS games store in the European Union. As [part of its 2023 year in review](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-games-store-2023-year-in-review), Epic Games announced Apple has reinstated its developer account, which means it will finally be able to let users download *Fortnite* on iPhones again. 

[Epic first announced](https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050800/epic-games-store-fortnite-apple-ios-launch-eu-dma) plans to bring its game store and *Fortnite* to iOS in January, but it wasn’t clear whether Apple would grant it a developer account.

In 2020, Apple pulled Epic’s developer account after the company began using its own in-app payment option [in the iOS version of *Fortnite*](https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments), sparking [a lengthy legal battle](https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown) over whether Apple’s behavior was anticompetitive. But even after the trial ended, and neither company emerged a clear winner, [Apple still refused](https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22687968/fortnite-ios-epic-apple-appeal-verdict-antitrust) to reinstate Epic’s developer account.

Things are changing now that the EU has implemented the Digital Markets Act (DMA). ==The new rules force Apple to open up its iOS ecosystem to third-party app stores in the EU.== Epic Games says it plans to open its iOS storefront in the EU this year. [[app store]] ^id-958998

“I’ll be the first to acknowledge a good faith move by Apple amidst our cataclysmic antitrust battle, in granting Epic Games Sweden AB a developer account for operating Epic Games Store and Fortnite in Europe under the Digital Markets Act,” Sweeney says in a post on X.

Despite this, [Sweeney](https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050696/epic-games-tim-sweeney-apple-app-store-response) and [many other developers](https://www.theverge.com/24051818/apple-app-store-dma-eu-developer-response) remain highly critical of Apple’s new policies. Apple’s [new fee setup](https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/26/24051823/apple-third-party-app-stores-50-cent-fee) for developers who decide to step outside Apple’s walled garden makes it less attractive for developers to put their apps in third-party stores and use alternative payment options.
