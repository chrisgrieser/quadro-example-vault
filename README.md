# Quadro: Example Vault
This is an example vault for [Quadro](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/obsidian-quadro), an Obsidian plugin that for conducting social-scientific qualitative data analysis (QDA).

Please visit the [documentation for Quadro](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/obsidian-quadro) for detailed information on how to use *Quadro*.

## Installing this Vault
1. Make sure your Obsidian version is at least 1.5.8.
2. [Download the vault](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/quadro-example-vault/releases/latest/download/quadro-example-vault.zip).
3. Open the directory `quadro-example-vault` as an Obsidian vault. ([If you are new to Obsidian, see the Obsidian Documentation on how to do that.](https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Create+a+vault#Open+existing+folder))

## Pre-Configured Plugin Setup
- **Quadro** itself
	- There are buttons to the far left for all Quadro commands. Briefly hover over them to see what each button does.
	- Quadro is configured to be auto-updated via the **BRAT plugin**.
- **Data Loom:** Analyze extractions in a dynamic spreadsheet, similar to Notion or Excel.
- **Dynamic Highlights**: Highlight specific words throughout the vault. Useful to highlight keywords in the data. 
	- In this example vault, the words "iOS" and "Android" are highlighted (as you can see here).
- **Another Quick Switcher**
	- Search for Code Files only via `alt+c`.
	- Search for Extraction Files only via `alt+e`.
	- Search for Data Files only via `alt+d`.
- **Properties View**: View all properties ( = extraction dimensions) in the entire vault, left-click on them to search for them directly, right-click to rename dimensions globally.
- **AI Summary**: Use AI to summarize documents. (Requires an OpenAI Account.)
- **Supercharged Links:** Visually distinguish links to Code Files and links to Extraction Files:
	- Example link to a Code File: [[Compatibility]]
	- Example link to a Extraction File: [[app store problem/1]]
	- The plugin also allows you to color different individual codes or extraction types differently.
	Customize the appearance of the links via the companion plugin **Style Settings**.
- **Command Palette** (`cmd+p` on macOS, `ctrl+p` on Windows): includes a list of all relevant commands for QDA at the top. 
- **File Recovery**: Configured to automatically create versioned backups of any file every 5 minutes. Accessible via the **Command Palette**.


## Demonstration of QDA with Quadro
### Example Data
A few data files for demonstration purposes, all stored in the folder `Data`
- Two mock interviews with app developers for iOS and Android.
	- [[Mock Interview A (iOS developer)]]
	- [[Mock Interview B (Android developer)]]
- A few articles downloaded with the [MarkDownload Browser Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/markdownload-markdown-web/pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi)
	- [[Verge Article A]]
	- [[Verge Article B]]
	- [[Verge Article C]]
- The file [[AI-supported Summaries]] contains instructions for creating summaries with OpenAI.

### Example Codings
A few example codes can be found in the folder `Codes`.
- The data was coded for [[app store]], [[WebApps]], and [[Compatibility]] issues.
- An illustrative [[Example Code Co-occurrence]] has been done for [[app store]] and [[WebApps]]
- You can click at the Graph Button in the left sidebar (or `ctrl+g`/ `cmd+g`) to open the Graph View. It has been configured to display only Data Files and Code Files.
 
### Example Extractions
 A few example extractions can be found in the folder `Extractions`.
- Some extractions have been made on compatibility issues, and the results aggregated in a dynamic table (called "Looms", since provided by the **Data Loom** Plugin): [[compatibility challenges (Aggregation).loom]]
- There is also an [[Example Search for Co-occurrent Extraction Dimensions]], extractions where two dimensions have a specific value.

## Using this vault for your own research
If you want to use this vault for your own project, you can just delete the content of the folders `Codes`, `Extractions`, `Analysis`, and `Data`. That way, only the pre-configured plugin setup remains.

> [!TIP]
> You might want to rename this vault, so it is not titled `quadro-example-vault` anymore. To do so, click the small vault icon at the bottom left, close this window, right-click `quadro-example-vault` and select `Rename Vaultâ€¦`. After that, double-click your newly named vault to re-open it.

### Download Webpages
To directly download webpages into your this vault, you need the [MarkDownload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi) Browser extension. In the settings for MarkDownload, you need to enable Obsidian integration, and the name of this vault, and you are all set. (The *Advanced URI Plugin*, which is also required by *MarkDownload*, is already pre-installed in this example vault.)

You can also import the example settings used to download the *Verge* articles found in this vault: [MarkDownload example settings](./Extras/MarkDownload-example-settings.json). (Just remember to change the vault name in the settings, if you change the name of this vault.)
